Atom names contain duplications -- renaming all atoms.
WARNING:  structure contains double bonds but no aromatic bonds
  Aromatic bonds must be identified explicitly --
  alternating single/double bonds (Kekule structure) won't cut it.
  This warning does not apply to you if your molecule really isn't aromatic.
